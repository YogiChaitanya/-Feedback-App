            "1. **Current Status**: The login issue has been resolved for 80% of users, with bug #3421 still pending. Phase 2 deployment has been rescheduled from the 15th to the 19th, allowing additional time for thorough testing.\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Risks**: A key risk identified is insufficient test data for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). This could potentially delay the project timeline if not addressed promptly.\n",

            "4. **Next Steps**: The development team will finalize API changes, while the testing team focuses on completing regression tests. \n",
